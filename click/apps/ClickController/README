    This Java program is a graphical user interface for interacting with
user-level Click configurations via the ControlSocket(n) element. Say a
Click configuration is running on host HOSTNAME with a ControlSocket
element listening on port PORT. Then you can start ClickController with the
command line

	java ClickController HOSTNAME PORT

to see the configuration, including its elements and their handlers.

    The ClickController program is preliminary and is being provided "as is".
Would you like to hack on it? Please do! Compiling it requires Java-1.2 or
above, including the Swing elements.

COMPILING AND RUNNING
---------------------

    ClickController requires the Java-1.2 or later runtime. You can
download one version of this runtime from Sun's web site, java.sun.com. On
Linux, for example, you can install the j2re-1.3.1 package, then run
`jikes' and `java' as follows:

	jikes -classpath /usr/java/jre1.3.1/lib/rt.jar:. *.java
	/usr/java/jre1.3.1/bin/java ClickController [ARGS]
