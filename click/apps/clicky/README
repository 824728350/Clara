CLICKY GUI FOR CLICK CONFIGURATIONS
===================================

INSTALLATION
------------

    To install the Clicky GUI, start by installing Click itself.

	cd CLICKDIR
	./configure --prefix=CLICKPREFIX ...
	make install

    Make sure your system has the necessary libraries and packages
installed.  On a Debian or Ubuntu system, this will include automake,
autoconf, libtool, libgtk2.0-dev (or libgtk2-dev), and graphviz.  Then:

	cd CLICKDIR/apps/clicky
	autoreconf -i
	./configure [--prefix=PREFIX] --with-click=CLICKPREFIX
	make install

TESTING
-------

    Try the following:

	clicky -r CLICKDIR/conf/test-clicky.click &

    Then click on the elements and change their handlers.  For instance,
change the TimedSources' "interval" handlers to smaller numbers and watch
the queues fill up.
