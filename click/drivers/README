This directory contains polling device drivers usable with Click.

Our newest polling device drivers can be created by downloading a version
of the driver and applying a patch.  We provide patches for e1000-7.6.15.5
and e1000e-0.4.1.7, and other versions.  e1000e is the new version of the
e1000 driver, suitable for newer cards.  In general you should prefer
drivers and patches with higher version numbers.
