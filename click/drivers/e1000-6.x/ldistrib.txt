SuSE LINUX Enterprise Server 8 IA64 causes unresolved symbols
=============================================================

If you get unresolved symbol errors when loading the e1000 driver, perform
the following:

  1. cd /usr/src/linux
  2. make cloneconfig
  3. make dep

Then rebuild the driver.


SuSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 warning message during driver build
==================================================================

While building the driver on SuSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 installations, 
the following warning or something similar may be displayed. It is safe to 
ignore this message. The driver will load and function normally.

Symbol version dump /usr/src/<kernel-version>-obj/<arch>/<kernel flavor>/
Module.symvers is missing, modules will have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS disabled. 

While loading the driver, ignore the warnings in the syslog:

  linux kernel: <driver name>: no version for "struct_module" found: kernel 
  tainted.
   
  linux kernel: <driver name>: unsupported module, tainting kernel.


Red Hat Linux 7.1 - Creating an RPM from tar / zipped File
==========================================================

When trying to generate an RPM from the .tar.gz file, a segmentation fault 
(core dump) occurs. This failure occurs because Red Hat Linux 7.1 uses 
version 4.0.2 of the RPM utility. This version does not have the ability to 
handle parameterized macros, which are used within the e100 and e1000 spec 
files to generate an RPM. Updating the RPM utility to a more current version 
resolves the issue. The utility can be obtained from http://www.rpm.org.


ACPI enable may cause Dual Port PRO/1000 Adapters to fail
=========================================================

If ACPI is turned on in the kernel, dual port adapters may not work. 
This is due to a limitation in ACPI. Currently, this affects all new 
versions of SuSE.


Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
===============================

2.1 Distribution
----------------

If there are errors while compiling the driver, do the following:

  1. Change to the kernel source directory.
  2. Perform all the required steps to build the kernel up to and including
     make dep.
  3. Modify EXTRAVERSION in the Makefile in Red Hat kernel source directory
     to match the version of the running kernel.
  3. Build the driver, using instructions located in the README file.

While building the driver, ignore the warning:

   /lib/modules/2.4.9-e.34/build/include/linux/rhconfig.h:31:60:
   operator '(' has no left operand

NOTE: For Red Hat's procedure for building a Linux kernel we recommend 
visiting their web site at www.redhat.com.
NOTE: This problem is resolved in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 Update 4.

2.5.50 Distribution
-------------------

In Redhat Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL4), unplugging network cable while ethtool -p 
is running will cause sytem to become unresponsive to keyboard commands, except 
for control-alt-delete.  Restarting the system appears to be the only remedy.  

This occurs in distributions later than v2.5.50. 


Loading and unloading modules with the Linux 2.6 Kernel
=======================================================

A new kernel API has been implemented within the Linux 2.6 kernel regarding 
the module reference count. This results in the e100, e1000 and ixgb drivers  
being used with a module reference count of zero. Consequently, our driver 
module can be removed from the system while still being used by other modules. 
Until the other modules within the Linux stack use the new API, unintended 
consequences may occur with module removal. This may result in system hangs 
and/or panics.


Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 with Intel(R) Desktop Board D915GEV
==============================================================

If you are using a system based on an Intel(R) Desktop Board D915GEV, and install 
a PCI Express (PCIe) adapter, and run a Linux distribution with the v2.4 kernel 
(such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3), the system may panic or hang.  This 
behavior has been observed with various brands of PCIe adapters besides those 
from Intel.  This does not occur on a Linux distribution with a v2.6 kernel, such 
as Red Hat EL 4 AS or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 9.  Booting with the 
'noapic' kernel parameter should also workaround this problem for systems running 
with a 2.4 kernel. 


Support
=======

For general information and support, go to the Intel support website at:

  http://support.intel.com

If an issue is identified with the released source code on the supported 
kernel with a supported adapter, email the specific information related to 
the issue to linux.nics@intel.com.
