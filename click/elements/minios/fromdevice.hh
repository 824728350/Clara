FromDevice(DEVID)

=s netdevices

reads packets from network device (mini-os)

=d

This manual page describes the mini-os version of the FromDevice
element. For the Linux kernel module element, read the FromDevice(n) manual
page.

Reads packets from the kernel that were received on the network controller
named DEVID. This element enqueues packet in the interrupt context to be afterwards
handled in the router.

=back

=e

  FromDevice(0) -> ...

=n

=h count read-only

Returns the number of packets read by the device.

=h reset_counts write-only

Resets "count" to zero.
