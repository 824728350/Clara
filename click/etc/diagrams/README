This directory contains the macros we use to generate diagrams for Click
papers, and some example diagrams (in the samp*.mp files).

You will need John Hobby's MetaPost, which is available from

	http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html

or in most Unix TeX distributions.

Eddie Kohler wrote the macros and most of the diagrams in 1999-2000, with
many updates since.
