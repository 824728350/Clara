# Clara Compute Prediction

Take the data generated by ClickGen -> Training Data Generation pipeline as input, train and test compute prediction
ML models

## Purpose of files

* `compute_prediction.sh`: Run ML inference models and get testing accuracy (WMAPE) on both synthetic and real click programs.
    * The results could be slightly different from the curret version of paper due to dataset expansion and model retraining efforts
* `models`: A folder including pretrained ML models for quick inference experiments.
* `preprocess.py`, `embedding.py`: Generate the input embedding and output num of instructions ready to be used. 
* `*_test.py`: ML inference models ready to be tested.
* `lstm_train.py` Clara lstm ML training model.
* `*.pickle` Anonymized data used for training and testing.   

## Run the scripts

Download dataset from this link: [``compute_dataset``](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4etkf0sm85r3z7q/compute_dataset.tar.gz?dl=0).
Then simply run `sh compute_prediction.sh` to evaluate embedding generation and inference experiments.
The accuracy of each model should be shown on the screen.
