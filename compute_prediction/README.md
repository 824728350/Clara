# Clara Compute Prediction

Take the data generated by ClickGen -> Training Data Generation pipeline as input, train and test compute prediction
ML models

## Purpose of files

* `compute_prediction.sh`: Run ML inference models and get testing accuracy (WMAPE) on both synthetic and real click programs.
    * The results could be slightly different from the curret version of paper due to dataset expansion and model retraining efforts
* `dataset`: A folder including all synthetic data from training data generation pipeline. Serves as the primary training data of all models
* `testset`: A folder including real click program data to be tested.
* `models`: A folder including pretrained ML models for quick inference experiments.
* `preprocess.py`, `embedding.py`: Generate the input embedding and output num of instructions ready to be used. 
* `*_test.py`: ML inference models ready to be tested.
* `lstm_train.py` Clara lstm ML training model.
* `*.pickle` Intermediate data files which contains intermediate python data structures.  

## Run the scripts

Simply run `sh compute_prediction.sh` to run embedding generation and inference experiments.
The accuracy of each model should be shown on the screen.
