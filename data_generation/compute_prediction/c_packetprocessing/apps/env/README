#
# Overview
#
# This project contains firmware which will program a Netronome NIC
# to act as a wire. As an example, packets ingressing on port 0 will
# egress on port 1, or packets ingressing on port 1 will egress on
# port 0.
#
# When packets are received counters will be incremented according
# to which layer 2 and 3 headers are present in the packet. After
# this is done, the packet will be egressed.
#

#
# Build firmware
#
make

#
# Load and run firmware
#
./init/wire.sh restart ./wire.fw

#
# Counters
#

# Mac Counters. Packets received will increment the port
# stats of the port on which it was received. This value is
# cleared after reading.
nfp -m mac show port stats 0 0-11

# Application Counters. Display the cntrs_if0 and cntrs_if1 runtime symbols
# which will increment according to the layer 2 and 3 headers of the received
# packet.
nfp-rtsym _cntrs_if*
